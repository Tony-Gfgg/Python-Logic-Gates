# Python-Logic-Gates
These are some logic gates created in Python. They are created as functions, so just call them when needed. This is also my first Github repository :)


How to use:

Call the function for the respective gate, there are currently two gates so far:

Not Gate (gate_not())
And Gate (gate_and())

For the argument, you only need one for the not gate, and two for the and gate. They only take 1s and 0s like binary, and I haven't tested anything else.

If wanted, you could probably use these two gates to create even more logic gates (NAND, OR, etc.)


If any issues occur, please let me know and I'll try to fix them. I also plan on creating more of these gates for simplicity.
